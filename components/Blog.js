// This is my Daily Blog
// This is my journal both public and private when needed
// I want to trigger a tweet when this blog goes active
// I want to email a weekly recap of my blogs, codes, workouts

// Thu May 30
// Today im struggling with overwhelm. I need to make more money.
// I need to stop smoking weed. This are routinely my problems but
// I tend to let them fester time after time and cant squash them.
// Daily is the battle though. Just fester up courage daily.
// You can fight this urge. This is a form of release from my mind
// with activity on the keyboard and an outlet for my thoughts

// Fri May 31
// Another day of battle. From staying away from the weed pen, to
// doing my best avoid binging, the daily struggle is real and unavoible. Its
// just a strength you gott learn with time and find the ease and grace to sit through it.
// Each day though is about striving for a tad bit more of tangible work and uncomfortable situations.
// Tomorrow ill be sure to remind myself that the interday battle is always there.

// Sat Jun 1
// Here on my laptop for the 3rd day in the row feeling proud of my routine fitting into my day regardless of activity.
// I'm still battling binges and weed cravings, but I know this is a day by day battle I just need to ride the waves of.
// I'm dedicated to React and pursing this through Mimo's beginner foundations and then Code Signal to nail my skills for interviews.
// This is my personal website that should also have dark mode and this blog tab that also posts when I work out from strava.
// Accountability and daily check ins empower me. This method is really helpfeul here for just moving the needle brick by brick.

// Sun Jun 2
// Fantastic date night last night with Madison. We went to Mozza and started the night with a drink at Gigi's.
// Just a great intimate night.
// This morning I'm trying to get a quick workout in before the big day of planning.
// Need to bike to Weschester and have an important early morning tomorrow so I better be well rested and prepared.
// My new boss seems like he enojoys his power.

// Mon Jun 3
// Im exhausted. Dont wait to do this. Get your desired tasks done first thing.

// Tue Jun 4
// Another day I left this to the very end. I'm in bed, eat 1000 cals via orgain and did hot yoga and lots of walking.
// I did vape a bunch which needs to be fixed.
// Javascreipt is my jam

// Wed Jun 5
// Drunk tonight and left this for too late once again.

// Thu Jun 6
// Its the day before i bend the knee. And the first day of nba finals.

// Fri Jun 7
// Today is engagement day and I'm stoked the day is here finally.
// In san diego up early, not sure what to do with myself.
// Maybe go for a slow jog to a park with some pull up bars.
// I dont have the money nor want to spend it to go to the local gym.

// Tue Jun 11
// Its been a few long social days of family friends and celebration. Booze, little sleep,
// Intense convo and envirograting topics keeping me up at night.
// I've found solice in getting back to the regular routine of shopping wood and carrying water.
// Wait, don't retreat to story, pause, deep breath.

// Thu Jun 13
// Today was a medley of highs and lows. Binge, vape, workout.
// Now Im trying to get intiimate.

// Fri Jun 14
// Ive been working on been consistency like no other. Writing everyday. Trying to code.
// Nailing my systems so I can let the rest do the talking. I want to be about it, not talk
// about it. That means being actionable in the identity you'd like to have. Showing up daily
// to the mat, to the keyboard, to the writing journal, to the court, is where you find your
// humanity. You realize we ebb and flow and the best we can do is show up and see what
// we're capable of. Just keep trying brother!

// Sat Jun 15
// Early strong start to my day here in Arrowhead. A nice long walk to start the day. And now a day of relaxtion.
// I got my tough efforts in with coding and journaling and meditating and excerising. Now its time to calm down.
// Theres lots of options in how to relax today. I just need to learn to just be and find solum in peace and slow.
// Articulating your thoughts makes your vision so much clearer and focused. Just getting the damn junk out
// of my head invirogates me to perform.

// Sun Jun 16
// Today was a beautiful day here on the lake. My parents met us here in Lake Arrowhead. I have somewhat of
// Sunday scaries going into a work week that feels slow and light. We will be driving home tonight after a nice
// fathers day dinner. Ive really been craving though. I don't really know what all these feelings are.

// Mon Jun 17
// Today I got confronted about not using my laptop enough on Friday's day of work. It's good accountability, but
// fairly crazy oversight. I need to work harder. And this was a great gut check. I also had a great lunch with Tigran
// and a honest heart to heart. He advised an account executive role. I also had a great training session on
// functional patterns.

// Tue Jun 18
// Another day of work and I am a bit more comfortable in my new role learning insurance op details. It's a reminder to
// trust the process. Im feeling alright after functional patterns-I went to Y7 scuplt today which was brutal but I
// went in knowing I'd hang back. I'm excited about all that I've learned. My pysch appointment went well and she presribed
// me Vyvance finally. I think that will help bring the consistency I need as a rooted foundation to my life. Will
// help me stay sober and on task and less anxious. Oh well, here's another night I'm using the vape however. We will see
// how this evolves....

// Wed Jun 19
// Too tired

// Thu Jun 20
// Another tired day.

// Tue Jun 25
// Today's been a dousy. My first Marijuana Anoyomous meeting went well. It was a lot more eye opening than I was expecting.
// All walks of life, small and big, male and female, loving and cold etc. I had to resist the urge to smoke today but I used
// edible capsules today to help me taper as much as I could. I really should find a meeting for tomorrow. They say 90 meetings in your first 90 days is really the best way to go about it.
// I feel strong and "in control" but one thing that MA teaches is that you are NOT in control, and that you are the will of a higher force.
// And you must be able to live with that higher force. I may be taking too many tasks on at once but isnt that what I'm all about? Focused intention?

// Wed Jun 26
// Another successful day of no smoking. Lots of mixed intense feelings that are tough to sit with. But the ups and
// downs are life. Time to get serious and intentive about my goals but also realize I need to slow down.

// Thu Jun 27
// Today was another tough day. I was up super early from the open window due to broken AC.
// I still havent admitted to MA but ive attended my third session. It's really helpful to hear those difficult stories
// from those that may have struggled even more than myself.
// Its crazy to hear from 'normal' people that have the same issue as me. It's quite satisfying to be honest.
// The human experience requires suffering. Mindfulness says that, therapy says that, buddism says that etc

// Fri Jun 28
// Today is day 4 of my reset and it's quite the rollercoaster of emotions. Conviction, doubt, tireness, energy, motivation, positivity etc.
// Im dealing with the withdrawls of cannabis. Hi Im Jensen and I am an addict. I have been smoking weed for 10 years now as a security blanket
// to deal with the inevitable tough emotions that arise from life. I'm doing my best to stay busy so I don't relapse and
// deal with too many of the withdrawls. I have a new refound focus on switching jobs and am excited about moving into a sales
// engineering role/environment. I think my next role should probbaly be sales, I need that hungry competitive environment that brinigs out
// the best in people. Reading Frank's book is probbably a good way to get inside the head of a sales hirer. I really found myself wanting to
// distract and numb myself as much as possible at work today. I kept wanting to look at job descriptions etc.
// I've def had some paranoid thoughts and think it's from marijuana withdrawls. I just need to stay the course and keep to the program
// and supportive community.

// Sat Jun 29
// Step 1: Admitting Powerlessness. Write about your experiences with marijuana.
// When did you first realize it was becoming a problem? How has your life been unmanageable due to your use?
// I guess the real first time was in college when my highschool friends wanted to hang out but I was so addicted I
// just wanted to leave and get high. I couldnt socialize, I was antsy, needing to find a high. In was in the Palisades and I remember it well.
// We were at the Perrs and they really wanted to socialize with all the kids, but I had my own prioirities.
// I'm still going through the withdrawls so it's hard to fully understand what it did for me. But it was protection, control,
// deeper intelluctual thinking, but it then lead to paranoia. I was cutting corners in every area if my life to carve out space to
// get high and chill. One thing the MA host today said that really spoke to was Marijuana has 3 typical stage: magic, medicine, then misery.
// I'd gotten to the point of misery where I wasnt accomplishing any of my goals anymore and was paranoid I had serious mental health issues.

// Mon Jul 1
// Busy life has gotten in the way of my personal routines like journaling, MAing, walking, foam rolling. Finding time like this to put thoughts
// down in writing is the exact therapy I need to reqire my personal talk.

// Step 2: Believing in a Higher Power

// Reflect on your concept of a higher power. What does it mean to you to believe that a power greater than yourself can restore you to sanity? How can this belief influence your recovery journey?
// Step 3: Turning Over to a Higher Power

// Consider what it means to turn your will and your life over to the care of your higher power. What challenges do you face in letting go of control? How can you start to trust this process?
// Step 4: Moral Inventory

// Make a list of your resentments, fears, and other emotional struggles. How have these affected your behavior and your relationships? What patterns do you notice?
// Step 5: Admitting Wrongs

// Choose one or two items from your moral inventory and write about them in detail. How do you feel about admitting these to yourself, to your higher power, and to another person?
// Step 6: Readiness for Removal of Defects

// Reflect on your character defects. What are you willing to change about yourself? What fears do you have about these changes?
// Step 7: Asking for Removal of Defects

// Write a prayer or a letter to your higher power asking for the removal of your shortcomings. How do you feel about asking for help in this way?
// Step 8: List of Persons Harmed

// Create a list of people you have harmed through your addiction. How have your actions impacted them? How do you feel about making amends?
// Step 9: Making Amends

// Choose one person from your list and write about how you plan to make amends. What steps will you take? How might this person respond?
// Step 10: Continued Inventory

// Write about a recent situation where you recognized a character defect in action. How did you handle it? What can you learn from this experience?
// Step 11: Improving Conscious Contact with Higher Power

// Describe your current practice of prayer and meditation. How does it help you stay connected to your higher power? What changes can you make to improve this practice?
// Step 12: Carrying the Message

// Reflect on how you can share your recovery experience with others. How can you be of service to those still struggling with addiction? What does it mean to practice these principles in all your affairs?
